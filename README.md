What even is this?
------------------

TL;DR It's a calendar app.

Yeah, but why?
--------------

Years ago I designed an algorithm to tile appointments on a calendar in an aesthetic way, well I'm implementing it in Rust now and compiling to WASM. Figured I'd make a nice monorepo for everything, and build out some other nicities I've always wanted to implement myself in TypeScript. May also implement the solution in Go and AssemnlyScript just as a fun exercise to compare WASM execution times cause why not?
